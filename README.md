You are in charge of a public health office in a large metropolitan area. There’s currently a COVID-19 outbreak, and due to recent budget cuts, you’ve also been appointed as the new bioinformatics expert (congratulations on the promotion!). Your responsibilities now include developing a pipeline to analyze NGS sequencing data for genome assembly, mutation detection, and lineage identification of sequenced samples.

You have two genomes to work with, and your pipeline should be capable of identifying mutations in both.

To achieve full credit (100%), submit the following deliverables:

Two tables (DataFrames) listing mutations for each genome.
A third table showing mutations shared between both genomes.
A simple chart (using any of the chart types introduced in the previous module) that visualizes an aspect of the data.
